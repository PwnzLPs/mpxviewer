This was a research project I did to mainly help me understand how to do 3D programming, early in the beginning revel8n messaged and asked if I wanted to help, heck yes I did.

So together, we made it what it is today.

It can view all models and areas for Metroid Prime 1
Although some areas are hard to control, hopefully someone can make it better one day.

It can view all the textures for the series 1-3

It reads the raw files from the .paks I was hoping for a pak viewer one day.

Anyway, I stopped working on it but revel8n still has plans, so he'll be one of the project managers, if you'd like to be able to help code for it please e-mail me, or IM me.

And I please ask that no exporters be made from this. I don't want anything illegal to come of it.

The project uses zlib, DevIL, and several other libraries all are included and I thank all the project creators for open sourcing them.
