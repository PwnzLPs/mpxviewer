Thanks for taking a look at this program. As of right now, I have not made any changes to the code.
Soon, I will be trying to fix dependencies that cause me to have to bundle this program with a few redistributables that
are required to run this. Hopefully, with some work, I can figure out how to prevent it from needing those redists.

Thanks!
